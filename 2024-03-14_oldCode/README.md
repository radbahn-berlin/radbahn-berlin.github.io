Maybe add Option to track which languages were used? Simple language? 
-> figure out how important translation to Arabic, etc. really is!  

Use AQR (accessible QR) code -> easier to scan / more resistant to "shitty aim" 
for example: https://www.navilens.com/accessibleqrcode/

I don' think I want to really go with jekyll, after all. It just seems to have way too much boiler plate and unneccessary complexity for such a small project. I'd rather know exactly what and why I'm doing what I'm doing, why I have certain files, etc.. 

New plan: go with basic html, css, js, but add some vue.js on top to simplify the reactive elements, instead of writing all of it from scratch. Might also add tailwind css later. And potentially go with vue's SFC, too. But for now, I'll keep it simple.
