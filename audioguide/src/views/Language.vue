<template>
    <div class="language">
        <h1>This would have the language controls.</h1>
        <p>Not sure if I want to do it over a separate view or simply via pop-up -> then language selector.</p>
        <p>Pop-up might be blocked...</p>
        <p>Use a hidden div, which is only loaded/shown if no localStorage and overrides all other content.</p>
    </div>
